# Dappify Module Boilerplate

Developers looking to create new Dappify modules can start from here. This is a barebones agnostic [Grapesjs](https://grapesjs.com) plugin, meaning it can work with Grapesjs alone as well. 

In the `src/index.js` the code for the function plugin can be found. For more information on how to create and edit plugins visit [Grapesjs documentation](https://grapesjs.com/docs/modules/Plugins.html)

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies

```
npm i
```

## Run

```
npm run start
```

## Build

```
npm run build
```

This will generate a `/dist` folder with your minified version of the module that can be imported later

## Publish

Follow the instructions provided by [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-publish)

## References

A good few set of example Grapesjs modules for reference can be found here in case you need to have a look on how others have built Grapesjs modules before
